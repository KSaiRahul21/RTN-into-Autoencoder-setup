# RTN-into-Autoencoder-setup

It is a part of academic project where a fundamental way to interpret communications system as an end-to- end trainable Neural Network (NN) task is defined in the form of Autoencoders. Later on, learned attention models known as Radio Transformer Network (RTN) are introduced into the network for easing the task of signal detection.
It is the implementation of the research paper published in [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.00716.pdf)
